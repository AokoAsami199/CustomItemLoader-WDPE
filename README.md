# CustomItemLoader-WDPE
A WaterdogPE plugin to support CustomItemLoader

# What this plugin does?
I experienced the client crash when I have more than two servers and transfer to another server.

This crash was caused by the ItemComponentPacket was sent during in-game sequence.

To prevent client crash, We need to prevent ItemComponentPacket from being sent during in-game.

# Do I need to do any configuration?
No, just throw this plugin to WDPE's plugins folder.
